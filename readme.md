# Form validation on hardmode

## What we will cover

* Form validation with Javascript
* Field validation
* Field validation of dependant fields (this is where it gets tricky)

## Notes

If you can, validate the entire form instead of each field!
If you are lucky you have nothing in the form that depends on something else.
If you have choices that are depending on each other, just reset the form!
